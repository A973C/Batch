#[Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/)

###A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 (and counting) icons for web and user interface design by [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft).

Each icon is a single Photoshop shape layer, meaning they can be scaled up—and down—without loss of quality. Adding layer styles and blend modes is also a breeze.

##Versions

As Batch is a growing resource, it made the most sense to host it on GitHub for the versioning and wiki features.

##Batch Font

[Matt Allen](https://twitter.com/sdmix) will be creating the Batch Font.

##Batch & Inuit.css

[Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) will be incorporating the Batch Font into [Intuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css).
