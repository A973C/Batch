#[Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/)

###A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 (and counting) icons for web and user interface design by [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft).

Each icon in the Batch PSD is a single shape layer, meaning they can be scaled up&mdash;or down&mdash;without loss of quality.

##Versions

As Batch is a growing resource, it made the most sense to host it on GitHub for the versioning and wiki features.

##Batch Icon-font

[Matt Allen](https://twitter.com/sdmix) will be creating the Batch Font.

##Batch & inuit.css

[Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) will be incorporating the Batch icon-font into [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css). You can keep an eye on progress on [the inuit.css issue tracker](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/issues/67).
